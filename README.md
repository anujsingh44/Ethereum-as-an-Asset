# Ethereum-as-an-Asset
This is research report on Ethereum in context of an asset in 2025. </br> I have made a pdf report using real data, with relevant information and tried covering the topics like Ethereum, its ecosystem, big moves, comparison, competitive advantage, and things that makes it a valuable asset. Diving into the research for this report gave me a lot of insights about ethereum, crypto, de-fi etc. </br>

I used Figma, Draxlr as tools to create this report, I cited various newsletter reports and data available on Ethereum's classic and other reputed websites to create this visual detailed backed by data report.
